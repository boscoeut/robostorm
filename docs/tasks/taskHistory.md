## [2025-09-21] - Robot Database Implementation with Version Tracking
**Status**: Completed
**Phase**: 1
**Priority**: High

### Summary
Implemented a comprehensive robot database system that enables the Robot Database page to display humanoid robots from a Supabase database. The system includes support for robot specifications, version tracking, manufacturer information, categorization, media management, user reviews, and advanced search functionality. Focus on humanoid robots including Tesla Optimus, Boston Dynamics Atlas, and Figure 01.

### Key Changes
- Frontend: Created comprehensive database schema for robots with version support
- Backend: Implemented 5 migration files with complete database structure, views, and security policies
- Database: Created tables for manufacturers, robots, categories, specifications, media, reviews, and user interactions
- Documentation: Created detailed task definition with 76-hour implementation plan

### Deliverables
- **Migration Files** (placed in `supabase/migrations/`):
  - `002_create_robot_database_tables.sql` - Core database schema with 9 tables
  - `003_seed_initial_robot_data.sql` - Initial data for 6 robots and manufacturers
  - `004_create_database_views_and_search.sql` - Optimized views and search functions
  - `005_create_row_level_security_policies.sql` - Comprehensive RLS policies
- **Database Features**:
  - Version tracking with parent-child relationships
  - Flexible specifications system (key-value pairs)
  - Full-text search with advanced filtering
  - Media management for images, videos, documents
  - User interaction tracking (favorites, reviews)
  - Comprehensive manufacturer and category systems
- **Security Implementation**:
  - Row Level Security (RLS) for all tables
  - Role-based access control (admin, moderator, contributor, user)
  - Public read access for active robots
  - Protected write operations
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - 25+ database indexes for query performance
  - Optimized views for common operations
  - Full-text search indexes
  - Computed fields for unit conversions
- **Initial Robot Data**:
  - Tesla Optimus (Generation 2) with detailed specifications
  - Boston Dynamics Atlas (Electric Model) with capabilities
  - Figure 01 with commercial focus details
  - Honda ASIMO (historical reference)
  - SoftBank Pepper (service robot)
  - Hanson Robotics Sophia (social robot)
- **Task Documentation**:
  - Comprehensive 76-hour implementation plan
  - Detailed technical specifications
  - Risk mitigation strategies
  - Success metrics and acceptance criteria

### Notes
This implementation provides a solid foundation for the robot database functionality. The schema is designed to be extensible and can accommodate future robot types beyond humanoids. The version tracking system allows for historical accuracy and development timeline tracking. The flexible specifications system means new robot attributes can be added without schema changes. All migration files are properly sequenced and include rollback instructions. The next step would be to update the RobotDatabasePage component to fetch and display this real data instead of the current placeholder content.

## [2025-09-20] - UI Navigation and Header Updates
**Status**: Completed
**Phase**: 1
**Priority**: High

### Summary
Updated the application's navigation menu options and header branding to better reflect the robot-focused purpose of the platform. Changed navigation items to Home, Robot Database, Industry News, and Admin Dashboard, and updated the header title to "Robot Data Hub".

### Key Changes
- Frontend: Updated navigation items in layout-store.ts and header content in Header.tsx
- Backend: No changes required
- Database: No changes required
- Documentation: Created comprehensive task definition following executeTask.md template

### Deliverables
- Updated navigation items: Home, Robot Database, Industry News, Admin Dashboard
- Changed header title from "Robostorm" to "Robot Data Hub"
- Updated header subtitle to "The IMDB for Humanoid Robots"
- Maintained existing authentication and responsive design features
- Task definition document with detailed implementation plan

### Notes
This was a straightforward UI update that aligned the navigation and branding with the robot-focused nature of the platform as outlined in the PRD. The change from "Vehicle Database" to "Robot Database" and the new header subtitle better reflect the application's purpose as a comprehensive humanoid robot database.

## [2025-09-19] - Admin Page Implementation for Logged-in Users
**Status**: Completed
**Phase**: 1
**Priority**: Medium

### Summary
Implemented a simple Admin page accessible only to authenticated admin users, featuring a basic placeholder header that says "Admin". The implementation leveraged existing authentication and navigation infrastructure.

### Key Changes
- Frontend: Simplified existing AdminPage.tsx to show minimal placeholder content with "Admin" header
- Backend: No changes required (existing Supabase auth and RLS policies sufficient)
- Database: No changes required (user roles already implemented)
- Documentation: Created detailed task definition following the executeTask.md template

### Deliverables
- Simplified AdminPage component with placeholder "Admin" header
- Protected route implementation ensuring only admin users can access
- Navigation integration showing Admin link for authenticated admin users
- Task definition document with comprehensive implementation details

### Notes
The AdminPage already existed with comprehensive placeholder content, but was simplified per user requirements. The existing authentication system (AuthContext) and navigation system (layout-store) already supported admin-only pages, requiring minimal changes. Future admin functionality can be built on top of this foundation.
