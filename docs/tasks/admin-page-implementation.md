# Task: Admin Page Implementation for Logged-in Users

## Overview
Create a simple Admin page accessible only to logged-in users with admin privileges, featuring a basic placeholder header that says "Admin".

## User Story
As a logged-in admin user, I want to access an Admin page so that I can manage administrative functions in the future.

## Requirements
- [ ] Admin page accessible only to authenticated admin users
- [ ] Simple placeholder design with "Admin" header
- [ ] Protected route implementation with proper authentication checks
- [ ] Navigation integration for admin users
- [ ] Responsive design following existing UI patterns

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
- Simplify existing AdminPage.tsx to show only placeholder content
- Ensure ProtectedRoute component properly protects the admin route
- Update navigation to include Admin page link for admin users
- Maintain consistent styling with existing UI components

### Backend Changes
- No backend changes required (authentication already implemented)
- Existing Supabase auth and RLS policies sufficient

### Database Changes
- No database changes required (user roles already implemented)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Admin page displays simple "Admin" header
- [ ] Page is only accessible to authenticated admin users
- [ ] Non-admin users see access denied message
- [ ] Unauthenticated users are redirected to home page
- [ ] Admin page is accessible via navigation for admin users
- [ ] Page follows responsive design patterns
- [ ] Loading states are properly handled

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for AdminPage component rendering
- Integration tests for authentication flow
- E2E test scenarios for admin access control

## Dependencies
- Existing authentication system (AuthContext)
- Existing routing system (React Router)
- Existing UI components (shadcn/ui)
- Existing user role management

## Estimated Effort
- Development time: 1 hour
- Testing time: 30 minutes
- Documentation time: 15 minutes

## Priority
Medium

## Phase
1

## Implementation Notes
- The AdminPage already exists with comprehensive placeholder content
- User specifically requests simple placeholder with just "Admin" header
- Need to simplify existing implementation while maintaining authentication
- Navigation should only show Admin link for admin users
- Future admin functionality can be built on top of this foundation
